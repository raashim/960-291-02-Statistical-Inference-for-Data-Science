In the weather disasters data:

Model the Y variables drought and wild fire as binomial functions using the logit link and consider delta.temp, year, and delta.temp*year as the x variables (delta.temp*Year includes all 3).

Use Akaike score and deviance differences to look at which is best model for each of the two.

Choose best models for each of drought and wildfire.
