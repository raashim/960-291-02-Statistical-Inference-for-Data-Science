Is there a difference in distributions of salaries between the 4 divisions?
Is there a difference in the way salary depends on performance between the 4 divisions?

1 look at all 4 divisions

2 For each division choose the minimal Cp lars model (20 points each division, 80 points total)

Check with scatterplots the predictions using the minimal CP lars model from the chosen division against actual salaries for each division (4 scatterplots, construct 4 predictions based on the 1 model )

After you do this for all 4 divisions (16 scatterplots) Use this to decide if it looks like there is a uniform process based on performance for choosing salary or not. Argue why or why not.

3 After youve done steo 2 building the lars model 4 times (so 16 plots) compare  the lars and lm model for the same variables predicting the salary for 1 division (1 scatterplot)  (20 points)

Compare the prediction (eg. just AElars vs AElm) and the coefficients. What have the coefficients done between Lars and LM???
